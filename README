This is "Cool Stuff in PostgreSQL 9", a talk I originally gave with Selena Deckelmann at LFNW2010.

It's in LaTeX - you can create a .pdf by running the Makefile (just 'make') against the .tex file.

Then run 'make clean' to get rid of the extra docs you don't need.

I'm still learning beamer, so the layout's not perfect.
