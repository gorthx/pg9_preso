This is "Cool Stuff in PostgreSQL 9", a talk I originally gave with Selena Deckelmann at LFNW2010.

It's in LaTeX - you can make a .pdf by running the Makefile against the .tex file.

Then run "make clean" to get rid of the extra docs you don't need.

Or, you can just read the .pdf itself.  I'm still learning beamer, so the layout's not perfect.
